# GraviCode: DSA Problem

This repository is the answer asked for in **Questions #1 or #2** of the assignment for the role of **Lead MERN Developer** in **Gravity Engineering Services**. There are two DSA problems among which I have been asked to pick one to solve. I've chosen **Question #2** for my submission. The `src/q2/index.ts` file is the actual artifact which has been asked for.
